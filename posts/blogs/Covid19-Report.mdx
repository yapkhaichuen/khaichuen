This project aims to generate a simple report about the current Covid-19 cases and deaths in Malaysia. Results are delayed by one day, data is provided by the Ministry of Health Malaysia Covid-19 public data. For the finished report, please refer to my [Github repository](https://github.com/yapkhaichuen/Daily-Covid-Report).

## Introduction
Normally, to see the Covid-19 numbers of my country (Malaysia), I would go to the [Malaysian Government Covid Now website](https://covidnow.moh.gov.my/) and look at the latest data. However, the data is quite confusing and too much details are provided. Hence, I decided to generate a simple report about the current Covid-19 cases and deaths in Malaysia. The report is really simple and easy to understand with a few numbers and straightforward graphs.

This are the few things to include in the report:
1. Daily confirmed cases
2. Daily deaths
3. Daily recovered
4. Updated and generated date/time

I'll make a Python script to generate the report and upload a JSON file to my Github repository. The script will also generate a simple visualization of the data. The Python file will run with GitHub Actions. The JSON file will write itself onto a table in the README.md markdown file with [Markdown Autodocs](https://github.com/dineshsonachalam/markdown-autodocs#readme). Everything is ran on GitHub Actions and the GitHub repository. Sounds confusing? Great, let's start!
## Data
The data is provided by the Ministry of Health Malaysia Covid-19 public data at [GitHub](https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public). The data is in a CSV format and is updated daily at 2359 hours. To use it, I decided to use the GitHub raw content to link the data.

## Tools
I'll use the following tools to generate the report:
1. [Python](https://www.python.org)
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
4. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
5. [Markdown Autodocs](https://github.com/dineshsonachalam/markdown-autodocs#readme)
6. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Process
1. Import the data from the CSV file
2. GitHub Actions generates the report into a JSON file
3. GitHub Actions generates the visualization
4. GitHub Actions writes the JSON data into a table in the README.md markdown file
5. GitHub Pages generates and displays the report into a HTML file

## Python Code
I've tested this out on my local machine on Python 3.10 but it should work on any Python 3.x version. This is for pulling the data and cleaning it as well as exporting it into a JSON file as data.json. The file is named *main.py* in the repo.

```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import datetime
import json
import pytz

# New Case Data
cases_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public/main/epidemic/cases_malaysia.csv"
col_list = ["date", "cases_new"]
cases_df = pd.read_csv(cases_url, usecols=col_list)
cases_today = cases_df.tail(n=1)
case_results = int(cases_today.cases_new)

# Death Data
death_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public/main/epidemic/deaths_malaysia.csv"
col_list = ["date", "deaths_new"]
death_df = pd.read_csv(death_url, usecols=col_list)
death_today = death_df.tail(n=1)
death_results = int(death_today.deaths_new)

# Recovery Data
recovery_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public/main/epidemic/cases_malaysia.csv"
col_list = ["date", "cases_recovered"]
recovery_df = pd.read_csv(recovery_url, usecols=col_list)
recovery_today = recovery_df.tail(n=1)
recovery = int(recovery_today.cases_recovered)

# Mount date
date_dirty = str(death_today.date)[-36:]
date_current = date_dirty[:-26]

# Current time of process for server to log. Malaysian time for refrence
KL = pytz.timezone('Asia/Kuala_Lumpur')
current_time = str(datetime.datetime.now(KL))

# Summary function
def short_summary():
      summary = [
            {
            "country": "Malaysia",
            "last updated": date_current,
            "cases": case_results,
            "deaths": death_results,
            "recovery": recovery,                  
            "generated": current_time
      }
      ]
      """save data to json file"""
      with open('data.json', 'w') as outfile:
            json.dump(summary, outfile, indent=4, sort_keys=False)
      return summary

# Call function
short_summary()
```
## Visualization Code
This Python script generates three graphs from the data. The graphs are: cases, deaths, and recovery. The file is named *visual.py* in the repo.

```python
from turtle import color
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Mount cases data
cases_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public/main/epidemic/cases_malaysia.csv"
col_list = ["date", "cases_new"]
cases_df = pd.read_csv(cases_url, usecols=col_list)
cases_today = cases_df

# Mount death data
death_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public/main/epidemic/deaths_malaysia.csv"
col_list = ["date", "deaths_new"]
death_df = pd.read_csv(death_url, usecols=col_list)
death_today = death_df

# Mount recovery data
recovery_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public/main/epidemic/cases_malaysia.csv"
col_list = ["date", "cases_recovered"]
recovery_df = pd.read_csv(recovery_url, usecols=col_list)
recovery = recovery_df

# Case Plot configurations
x1 = cases_today.date
y1 = cases_today.cases_new
plt.figure(figsize=(10,3)) 
plt.plot(x1, y1, linestyle = 'dashed')
plt.axis('off')
plt.savefig('./graphs/cases_graph.png', transparent=True, bbox_inches='tight')

# Death Plot configurations
x2 = death_today.date
y2 = death_today.deaths_new
plt.figure(figsize=(10,3)) 
plt.plot(x2, y2, linestyle = 'dashed', color="red")
plt.axis('off')
plt.savefig('./graphs/deaths_graph.png', transparent=True, bbox_inches='tight')

# Recovery Plot configurations
x2 = recovery.date
y2 = recovery.cases_recovered
plt.figure(figsize=(10,3)) 
plt.plot(x2, y2, linestyle = 'dashed', color="green")
plt.axis('off')
plt.savefig('./graphs/recovery_graph.png', transparent=True, bbox_inches='tight')
```

## GitHub Actions
The GitHub Actions workflow runs the Python script and generates the report and visualization. The report will be in a JSON format and the visualization will be in a PNG file. GitHub Actions (Markdown Autodocs) will also write the JSON data into a table in the README.md markdown file. The GitHub Actions workflow is in *.github/workflows/generate_report.yml*.

## GitHub Pages
The GitHub Pages will generate and display the report into a HTML file. Check out the deployment here:
[Daily Covid-19 Report](https://yapkhaichuen.github.io/Daily-Covid-Report/)

## Extra Stuff
To make my viewing of the data even easier, I configured it to run on my iPhone with Shortcuts. (A scripting tool for compatible Apple devices) If you want to use it on your Mac/iPhone/Apple Watch, you can download it here: [Covid-19 information Apple Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/77bf8a1a406e437fa939d172f28f987b). It can be triggered with Siri by saying "Covid-19" or pressing the button in the Shortcuts shelf widget.

## Conclusion
Here is the end result. Everything can be found on [my repo](), how you enjoy my little project. Leave a comment if you have something to add that can make it better. Give it a little star if you like it.
