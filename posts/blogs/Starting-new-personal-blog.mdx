I started this blog mainly to document my journey in technology and to share my thoughts on things that I'm interested in. I drew inspiration from [Scott Hanselman's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HE5LJwAv1k). This is my second brain, my personal journal and my library of thoughts.

Here are some of my interests:

* Data science
* Automation and scripting
* Networking
* Raspberry Pi's
* Robotics
* Customising

Thanks for checking out my blog. Let's see how long this last!
